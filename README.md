# APB Purchase History Tool

## Why I made this

I used to use a .jar file to parse through the purchase history, but that hasn't been updated in years so I wanted to have an up to date version which includes the G1C/$ changes from 2018.

## What do I need to run this

If you have a functional Windows system you shouldn't need anything.

## What does it look like

It looks like this:

## Download

You can pick it up from the [releases](https://github.com/Kevkof/APBPurchaseHistoryTool/releases/tag/1.0.0) here on GitHub or using the mirror on [my server](https://dl.kevkof.com/APBPurchaseHistoryTool.exe)

## Possible issues

- You might need to unblock the files, as it's downloaded from the internet.
- SmartScreen will probably give a warning of 'Unknown Publisher' but that is because I don't want to pay 100+$/year for a signing license.

- If you have questions on how to run the program or any issues you're getting you can always contact me on [kevkof@kevkof.com](mailto:kevkof@kevkof.com) or by messaging me on Discord (Kevkof#1994) or Git
